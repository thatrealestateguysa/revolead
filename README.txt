- Contacts/Bulk toggle is now clean and reliable; Bulk has sub-tabs (WhatsApp, Email, Scripts).
- 15 rows per page pagination with Prev/Next, page indicator.
- Checkbox in front of each row; Select-all applies to current page.
- ID number is preserved with leading zeros; Birthday autofills from SA ID (YYMMDD).
- Google Sheet web app URL prefilled (you can change in Data Source).

3) Use Data Source to connect your Apps Script web app.
4) Import CSV (template included) or use Add Contact.
